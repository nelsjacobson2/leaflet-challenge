# Leaflet Challenge

This project utilizes Leaflet, an open-source JavaScript library, to visualize earthquake data on an interactive map. The earthquake data is sourced from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and displayed using GeoJSON format.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

- Web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine

2. Navigate to the project directory

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

Upon opening the `index.html` file in a web browser, you will see an interactive map displaying earthquake data. The data points represent significant earthquakes that have occurred in the past month.

### Map Controls

- Zoom in and out: Use the zoom controls on the top left corner of the map.
- Base Maps: Select different base maps (e.g., street map, satellite map) using the layer control on the top right corner of the map.
- Earthquake Markers: Click on an earthquake marker to view additional information, such as magnitude, location, and depth.
- Legend: The legend on the bottom right corner of the map displays the color coding for earthquake depths.

## Technologies Used

- Leaflet.js - An open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.
- D3.js - A JavaScript library for data visualization.
- HTML - The standard markup language for creating web pages.
- CSS - The language for styling web pages.

## Acknowledgments

- United States Geological Survey (USGS) for providing earthquake data.
- Leaflet.js and D3.js communities for their excellent libraries and documentation.
